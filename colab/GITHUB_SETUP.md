# Pushing ARCHON-RH to GitHub for Colab

## Quick Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `archon-rh`
3. Visibility: Public or Private
4. Don't initialize with README (you already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Code

From your local directory, run:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\brand\OneDrive\Desktop\MATHEMATIC;Reasoning model"

# If not already a git repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: ARCHON-RH reasoning lab"

# Add your GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/archon-rh.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Update Colab Notebooks

Once pushed, update the clone command in your notebooks:
```python
!git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/archon-rh /content/archon-rh
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Option 2: Direct Upload to Colab (No GitHub)

If you don't want to use GitHub:

### Step 1: Zip Your Code Locally
```bash
# In PowerShell
cd "C:\Users\brand\OneDrive\Desktop\MATHEMATIC;Reasoning model"
Compress-Archive -Path "archon-rh\*" -DestinationPath "archon-rh.zip"
```

### Step 2: Replace Clone Cell in Notebook

Instead of:
```python
!rm -rf /content/archon-rh
!git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/archon-rh /content/archon-rh
%cd /content/archon-rh
```

Use:
```python
from google.colab import files
import zipfile

# Upload the zip file
print("Please upload archon-rh.zip")
uploaded = files.upload()

# Extract it
!unzip -q archon-rh.zip -d /content/archon-rh
%cd /content/archon-rh
!pwd
!ls -la
```

## Option 3: Google Drive Mount

### Step 1: Upload to Google Drive
1. Upload `archon-rh` folder to your Google Drive
2. Note the path (e.g., `/MyDrive/archon-rh`)

### Step 2: Replace Clone Cell
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Copy from Drive to Colab workspace
!cp -r /content/drive/MyDrive/archon-rh /content/archon-rh
%cd /content/archon-rh
!pwd
!ls -la
```

## Recommendation

**Use Option 1 (GitHub)** because:
- ✅ Cleanest solution
- ✅ Version control benefits
- ✅ Easy to share and collaborate
- ✅ Automatic updates when you push changes
- ✅ Standard workflow

**Use Option 2 (Direct Upload)** if:
- ⚠️ You want to keep code private (but GitHub has private repos)
- ⚠️ Quick one-time test

**Use Option 3 (Google Drive)** if:
- ⚠️ You frequently update files
- ⚠️ You want persistent storage across sessions
