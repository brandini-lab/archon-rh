2. File ‚Üí New notebook
3. Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí GPU (T4)
4. Follow instructions in `colab_notebook.txt` (copy each cell)
5. Training starts automatically!

**Time:** 5 minutes setup + 30 minutes training  
**Cost:** FREE

---

### Option 2: Lambda Labs (Production Quality)

```bash
# After creating Lambda instance:
git clone <your-repo> archon-rh
cd archon-rh
./launch_gpu_training.sh  # Interactive menu
```

**Time:** 10 minutes setup + 2 hours training  
**Cost:** ~$2-4 total

---

### Option 3: Your Local GPU (NVIDIA)

**Windows:**
```bash
cd archon-rh
launch_gpu_training.bat  # Double-click or run from CMD
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
cd archon-rh
./launch_gpu_training.sh
```

## üéØ What Actually Gets Trained?

The system trains a **GPT-2 style language model** that:
- Takes Lean proof goals as input (e.g., "‚ä¢ 1 + 1 = 2")
- Predicts the right tactic to apply (e.g., "rfl", "simp", "omega")
- Uses reinforcement learning to improve over time

**Use case:** Automated theorem proving for Riemann Hypothesis research

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

| Platform | GPU | $/hour | 4-hour training | Free Tier |
|----------|-----|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Colab** | T4 | $0 | $0 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Colab Pro** | V100 | ~$2.50 | $10/month | ‚úÖ Included |
| **Lambda Labs** | A100 | $1.10 | $4.40 | ‚ùå No |
| **RunPod** | RTX 4090 | $0.39 | $1.56 | ‚ùå No |
| **Vast.ai** | A100 | $0.80 | $3.20 | ‚ùå No |
| **AWS SageMaker** | A100 | $5.00 | $20 | ‚ùå No |

**Recommendation:** Start with Colab free, then move to Lambda/RunPod for serious runs.

## üîß Current GPU Support

‚úÖ **Already implemented:**
- Automatic GPU detection (`torch.cuda.is_available()`)
- GPU training in all models (`model.to(device)`)
- Batch processing on GPU

‚ö†Ô∏è **Can be added (2-4x speedup):**
- Mixed precision training (FP16/BF16)
- Gradient checkpointing (saves memory)
- Multi-GPU support (DataParallel/DDP)
- Weights & Biases logging

Run `python scripts/enhance_gpu_training.py` to see how to add these.

## üìà Expected Results

After training on GPU, you should see:

**Loss curves:**
- Start: ~8-10 (random)
- After 1K steps: ~4-6
- After 5K steps: ~2-3
- After 10K steps: ~1-2

**Proof success rate:**
- Baseline (random): ~5%
- After SFT: ~20-30%
- After RL: ~40-60%
- SOTA (with large models): ~80-90%

## üêõ Common Issues

### "CUDA out of memory"
**Fix:** Reduce `batch_size` in config:
```yaml
trainer:
  batch_size: 8  # Reduce from 32
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 8  # Compensate
```

### "No GPU detected"
**Fix:** 
- Colab: Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí GPU
- Local: Install CUDA toolkit + drivers
- Check: `nvidia-smi` should work

### "Training is slow"
**Fix:**
- Check GPU usage: `nvidia-smi` (should be 95%+)
- If low: Increase batch size or model size
- Enable mixed precision (see `enhance_gpu_training.py`)

## üÜò Need Help?

**Quick debugging:**
```bash
# Check GPU
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Check CUDA version
nvidia-smi

# Test training (30 seconds)
python prover/train/sft_hf.py orchestration/configs/colab_sft_gpu.yaml --max-steps 10
```

**Still stuck?**
1. Check GPU is enabled (Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí GPU in Colab)
2. Verify CUDA drivers installed (`nvidia-smi` works)
3. Try reducing batch size if OOM
4. Use CPU for testing: Training still works, just slower

---

## ‚ú® What's Next?

After successful GPU training:

1. **Evaluate model:** Test on held-out theorems
2. **Fine-tune:** Train on domain-specific Lean proofs
3. **Scale up:** Try larger models (1B+ params on A100 80GB)
4. **RL training:** Use PPO to improve beyond supervised learning
5. **Deploy:** Serve model with vLLM for fast inference
